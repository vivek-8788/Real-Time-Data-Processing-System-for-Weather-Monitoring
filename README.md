# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions in major metros of India, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API. The system retrieves key weather parameters, calculates daily aggregates, and triggers alerts based on user-configurable thresholds.

## Features
- Continuous data retrieval from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Calculation of daily weather aggregates: average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.
- User-configurable alert thresholds for temperature and weather conditions.
- Visualizations for daily summaries and historical trends.
- Extendable architecture for additional weather parameters and forecast functionalities.

## Data Source
The system retrieves weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). A free API key is required to access the data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized setup)
- API key from OpenWeatherMap

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring-system.git
   cd weather-monitoring-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

makefile
Copy code
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
(Optional) If using Docker, build and run the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Running the Application
To start the application, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Testing
To run the test cases, use:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Usage
The system retrieves weather data every 5 minutes by default, configurable in the code.
Alerts will be triggered based on user-defined thresholds, which can be adjusted in the configuration settings.
Visualizations
Access the visualizations through the web interface at http://localhost:3000 (or your specified port).
